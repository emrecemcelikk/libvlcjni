Subject: [PATCH 2/6] network: tls: Handle errors from older kernels

If MSG_FASTOPEN is defined, but turns out to be unimplemented by the
underlying kernel (as is the case on android where the NDK claims to
support fast open but some older kernels don't) EPIPE is returned
instead of EOPNOTSUPP.
See net/ipv4/tcp.c:936 & net/core/stream.c:55
sk_stream_wait_connect will return EPIPE if no SYN was sent/received,
and sendmsg will propagate that error.
Treating EPIPE as a synonym for EOPNOTSUPP here allows for the
connection to proceed, and the first call to sendmsg to complete as
expected.
